# sdLicense (schema:sdDatePublished, schema:sdLicense, schema:sdPublisher)

This extension allows the three structured data licensing related properties, `schema:sdDatePublished`, `schema:sdLicense` and `schema:sdPublisher` to be applied on all `schema:Thing` instances.

In schema.org, the sdLicense application was so far limited to `schema:CreativeWork`, which is not sufficient for applying structured data licenses to an entire knowledge graph. Therefore we extended the domain of those three properties to `schema:Thing`.
